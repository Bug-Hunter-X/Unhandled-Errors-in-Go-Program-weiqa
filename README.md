# Unhandled Errors in Go

This repository demonstrates a common error in Go programs: neglecting error handling.  The `bug.go` file shows a simple program that lacks proper error handling. The `bugSolution.go` file provides a corrected version. 

## Bug Description

Many Go functions return an error value alongside the result.  Ignoring these errors can lead to silent failures and difficult-to-debug issues.  The example program shows a scenario where this oversight can cause problems. 

## Solution

The solution involves explicitly checking for errors using `if err != nil` and handling them appropriately.  This could involve logging the error, returning an error to the caller, or attempting a retry or fallback mechanism.  Robust error handling is crucial for building reliable Go applications.
